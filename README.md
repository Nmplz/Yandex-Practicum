# Yandex prakticum: Automation QA Engineer

## Subrepository with my study practice in [Yandex Practicum](https://practicum.yandex.ru/qa-automation-engineer-python)

## 1. Python basics
###  Practice for the fundamentals of Python syntax, data types, control structures, functions, and basic file handling

## 2. OOP inheritance, polymorphism
### This section focuses on mastering the core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python, specifically inheritance and polymorphism. 

## 3. OOP encapsulation
### This section focuses on mastering the core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python, specifically encapsulation. Section focuses on how to protect and manage access to the internal state of objects using private attributes and methods, as well as  usage getters, setters, and Pythonâ€™s @property decorator effectively to build robust and maintainable code.

## 4. Unit test
### In this section, I learned the basics of writing unit tests using pytest. I practiced creating clear and focused test functions, using assertions to verify expected behavior, and organizing tests in a readable structure. I got comfortable with fixtures to set up and tear down test environments, and explored parameterization to cover multiple cases efficiently. Writing tests helped me understand my code better, catch edge cases early, and build the habit of thinking about reliability before diving into implementation.


## 5. UI test
### In this section, I learned how to write automated UI tests using Selenium WebDriver and pytest. I practiced interacting with web elements, locating them using various selectors, and performing actions like clicking buttons and filling out forms. I got familiar with using explicit waits to handle dynamic content and avoid flaky tests. I also learned how to structure UI tests using the Page Object Model (POM) to keep the code modular, clean, and reusable. This sprint helped me develop a better understanding of real-world UI automation challenges and build more stable, maintainable test suites.
